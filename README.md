# car4let
A sample application for renting cars created using Node, express, mongo and various other frameworks.
There are 2 users in the application, an admin and a normal user. 
A normal user can create an account, login, view all cars, rent a car and leave a review on a car. 
An admin can do everything a normal user can, but he can also add new cars, remove cars, remove reviews and remove bookings.
Here is the link to the app: https://car4let.herokuapp.com/
